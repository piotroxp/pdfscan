### Running the GUI

```bash
./target/release/pdfscan-gui
```

## Command-Line Usage

PDFScan also provides a powerful command-line interface:

### Text Extraction

Extract text from PDF files and save to a single output file:

```bash
# Extract from specific PDF files
pdfscan extract output.txt file1.pdf file2.pdf

# Extract from all PDFs in a directory
pdfscan extract output.txt /path/to/directory/

# Extract from multiple sources
pdfscan extract output.txt /path/to/directory/ file1.pdf
```

The output file will contain the extracted text with clear document boundaries:

```
[Start of document: file1.pdf]
... extracted text ...
[End of document: file1.pdf]

[Start of document: file2.pdf]
... extracted text ...
[End of document: file2.pdf]
```

### PDF Search

Search for text within PDF files:

```bash
# Search in the home directory
pdfscan search --search-phrase "search term"

# Search in specific directories
pdfscan search --search-phrase "search term" --directories /path1/ /path2/

# Search and create a ZIP file with matching PDFs
pdfscan search --search-phrase "search term" --directories /path/ --zip
```

### Statistical Analysis

Analyze keyword correlations across PDF files and rank documents by relevance:

```bash
# Basic analysis with multiple keywords
pdfscan analyze --keywords "machine learning" "neural networks" "deep learning" --input-paths /path/to/papers/

# Specify output file and correlation threshold
pdfscan analyze --keywords "blockchain" "cryptography" "security" --input-paths /papers/ --output-file analysis.txt --threshold 0.2
```

The analysis output includes:
- Keyword correlation matrix showing relationships between terms
- Ranked list of documents based on keyword relevance
- Statistical summary of keyword occurrences

This feature is useful for:
- Research paper analysis
- Finding related documents based on key terms
- Identifying thematic connections across documents

## Error Handling

PDFScan handles various error conditions gracefully:

- Invalid file paths
- Permission issues
- Corrupted PDF files
- Unicode/encoding challenges

Errors are reported to stderr while the application continues processing other files.
